Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:  
git clone https://github.com/sumit334/ConnectHub.git  
Change directory to the project folder:  
cd ConnectHub  
Install the project dependencies using npm:  
npm install  
Start the development server:  
npm start  
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.  
## Usage
Once the application is running, you will be prompted to allow access to your camera and microphone. Grant the permission to start using the video calling feature.

* To initiate a call:

       Click on the "Call" button and enter the ID of the person you want to call (their unique Socket.IO ID).
       Click on the "Call" button again to start the call.
* To answer an incoming call:

       When you receive an incoming call, a notification will appear on the screen.
       Click on the "Answer" button to accept the call.
* To end a call:

       During a call, click on the "Hang Up" button to end the call.
## How It Works
The application uses React to build the user interface. Socket.IO is employed to enable real-time communication between clients. When a user initiates or receives a call, the application sets up a peer-to-peer connection using WebRTC, allowing for direct video streaming between the clients.
